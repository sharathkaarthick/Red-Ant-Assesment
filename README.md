# Red-Ant-Assesment

Manoj is the Security admin of Red Ant media. He is responsible for security. What he has is a log book of entries and exits from the company. The Gate entry register. Every user marks the time that they enter in, who they are to meet, purpose of the meet and the time that they exit.<br/>

a. Write a program to take user entries capturing name, entry time, reason of visit, whom to meet, exit time<br/>
b. From the admin side, Manoj should be able to see who had the maximum visitors, what was the purpose for which most people came. These two are simple calculations.<br/>
c. Manoj also needs to know for Covid reasons, at what time of the day was the office occupied maximum. i.e., What time period was the busiest meaning maximum number of people inside the office. <br/>
d. The trick is Manoj will decide the time periodâ€™s duration. i.e., he may want to know which 30 minutes or 60 minutes or 15 minutes or 10 minutes did the company have the maximum number of people inside. He should be able to select the time duration.<br/>
